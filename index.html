								<p>Dear Reader,</br></br>
I am a creative engineer with skills and competence within both the research and development field who really enjoys when many things are happening at the same time. If your company is growing very fast, especially in my areas of interest, product design and services.Then I would very much like to contribute to the company’s future development and be a part of various teams.</br>
The goal with my education at Uppsala University has been to be able to work with user experience, behaviour and design of products and services. I am looking for positions with the right combination of technology and innovation work.</br>
I would really like to work with teams towards development which contribute to people’s wellbeing and health. I believe in hard work and perseverance leads to great things. I believe that one can gain experience from any job and use it in different domains. I do not hesitate to work for any company at any level, I find it interesting, and I really enjoy it. As a person I am welcoming, something which I have shown through extracurricular activities such as being responsible for the reception of new students and through different jobs in the education industry. I am also a creative person who likes to work with different assignments. To connect to people and maintain contacts is also something which I find stimulating. I have always been drawn towards people-oriented jobs. </br>
In my spare time I play the guitar or cycle to the outskirts of the city. I try to be outdoors in nature as often as possible and I love disc golf and bouldering. I also like playing board games and going for after-work with friends and colleagues. </br>
I look forward to meeting you for an interview.<br>
</br> 
Yours sincerely,</br> Sameer Mishra
